# twitchIdle
 A website that serves as my Twitch stream's idle scene.

## For the technologically uninitiated
 Here goes my attempt at explaining what this is.
 I stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/parrotflakes) using a program called [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). A 'scene' in OBS is best described as a combination of videos and images that make up a stream at any given moment. 
 For example, one might have a scene for when the stream is starting ("Stream starting soon," a display of the chatroom, usually coupled with exciting music) and another scene that displays the desktop as well as an alert box for follows and monetary tips. 
 
 So, using this project's GitHub Pages site as a URL for a 'browser' source, I can display it on my stream as the backdrop for a scene. I say 'idle' scene as in one I can use for when I start, when I end, when I switch games, etc; it is generic (as of right now) and multi-purpose.

Read the above section if you don't know much about livestreaming.
This is a display of my Twitch user and stream information provided by Twitch's API. You can find documentation for it [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api). Although thanks is likely not required, I appreciate the help of @RatWithAShotgun and @DBKynd on Twitch for helping me out with some API and JavaScript work that even StackOverflow couldn't solve for me.
